first we create "Basic" folder, then create index.css, index.html and main.js
tehn three.js->installation, copy index.html code of website to our index.html
add "import from a CDN" code to our index.html at the end of body tag

then we'll code our object in main.js file
now in index.html, write version for three<version>

ALTERNATING APPROACH:
now we'll move to vite.org--> Scaffolding your first vite project, copy command
and paste command on terminal of new folder(vite)
-->vanilla-->javascirpt-->npm i-->npm i three-->npm run dev

Delete counter.js and clean main.js and add objects to this file
edit index.html by changing <div id='app'> </div> to <canvas id='canvas'></canvas>

React with Three.js
Create new folder 'vite-react' and on terminal: 
npm create@latest
project name:./
React framework+js
npm i three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei
npm run dev

Clean App.jsx
